# Analysis of Cracked Passwords

## Password Length Distribution
Based on the cracked passwords, we have the following length distribution:

| Password     | Length |
|--------------|--------|
| password     | 8      |
| 123456       | 6      |
| qwerty       | 6      |
| password123  | 11     |
| admin        | 5      |
| letmein      | 7      |
| welcome      | 7      |
| monkey       | 6      |
| dragon       | 6      |
| iloveyou     | 8      |

Most of the passwords are relatively short, with lengths ranging from 5 to 11 characters. This highlights the importance of enforcing minimum password length requirements as part of a strong password policy.

## Recommendations
- **Minimum Length**: Passwords should be at least 12 characters long.
- **Complexity**: Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **No Common Passwords**: Avoid using common passwords and dictionary words.
- **Regular Updates**: Change passwords regularly, at least every 90 days.
- **No Reuse**: Do not reuse old passwords.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Implement two-factor authentication for additional security.
