# Strong Password Policies

Based on our password cracking and analysis, we recommend the following policies for creating strong passwords:

1. **Minimum Length**: Passwords should be at least 12 characters long.
2. **Complexity**: Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
3. **No Common Passwords**: Avoid using common passwords and dictionary words.
4. **Regular Updates**: Change passwords regularly, at least every 90 days.
5. **No Reuse**: Do not reuse old passwords.
6. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Implement two-factor authentication for additional security.

Implementing these policies can significantly improve security and protect against password cracking attacks.
